Prismatic Shard Calculator
---

This tool will look at your save file and tell you how many geodes you have to crack in order to get a prismatic shard. Note that for the geode where you get the prismatic shard you must use a omni geode. IE if you could get a prismatic shard on your 77th geode, you must process an omni geode to get it. Using any other geode will not give you a prismatic shard, and will waste the attempt.
