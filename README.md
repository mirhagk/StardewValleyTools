Prismatic Shard Calculator
---

This tool will look at your save file and tell you how many geodes you have to crack in order to get a prismatic shard. Note that for the geode where you get the prismatic shard you must use a omni geode. IE if you could get a prismatic shard on your 77th geode, you must process an omni geode to get it. Using any other geode will not give you a prismatic shard, and will waste the attempt.

To run this calculator run `.\Calculator.exe --shard` or without options and select the prismatic shard option

Mushroom Level Calculator
---

This tool looks at your save file and tells you what levels of the mine have "mushroom levels", which are levels with pretty rainbox lights and lots of mushrooms. Note that monster levels could override this, so it's not an absolute guarantee.

To run this calculator run `.\Calculator.exe --mushroom` or without options and select the mushroom level option
